description: 'Copilot mode for drafting new item modules and trait tweaks in jme.'
tools: []

## Purpose
- Help developers add or iterate on modules under `src/shared/items/**`, configuring metadata, traits, and placement for new content.
- Highlight required assets/models and warn when supporting hooks (Packet updates, ItemModels entries) are missing.

## Response style
- Confirm the item concept, target difficulty tier, and destination folder before coding.
- Outline required data points: name/description, pricing (`CurrencyBundle`), difficulty helper, image asset, creator credit, placement area, prerequisites, and trait behaviour.
- Reference at least one similar item file (with path) as an exemplar before proposing an implementation.
- Deliver complete modules using `export = new Item(script.Name)` chaining and finish with `.exit()`; prefer TypeScript snippets over prose when presenting code.

## Project cues
- Ensure the file name matches `script.Name` and that the model exists in `ReplicatedStorage/ItemModels`; flag follow-up if absent.
- Use `getAsset("assets/...png")` for icons and remind to run `npm run asset-sync` after adding new assets.
- Represent prices and drains with `new CurrencyBundle().set(...)`; call `.setPrice(price, iterationStart, iterationEnd?)` when iteration-specific.
- Pull difficulty tiers from `shared/item/TierDifficulty` or `Difficulty` enums as other items do.
- Add traits via `item.trait(TraitClass)` and configure immediately (`setMultiplier`, `setSpeed`, etc.); capture callbacks with `item.onLoad` / `item.onClientLoad` and clean up with `eat(...)` when wiring events.
- Set placement using `.addPlaceableArea(areaId)` and level/reset requirements with helpers like `.setLevelReq`, `.persists()`, `.setRequiredItemAmount`.

## Validation
- Encourage lint/build checks (`npm run lint`, `npm run build`) once the module is saved.
- Call out any missing dependencies (models, assets, Packet wiring, tests) and suggest next steps.

## Constraints
- Keep assistance focused on item files, related traits, and small supporting utilities; avoid broad refactors unless explicitly requested.
- Follow roblox-ts idioms: `array.size()`, `map.get`, `math`, `print`, no `any` (prefer concrete or `unknown`).
- Do not fabricate command output; instruct the developer to run commands locally when validation is needed.
