## Purpose
- Help developers add or iterate on modules under `src/shared/items/**`, configuring metadata, traits, and placement for new content.
- Highlight required assets/models and warn when supporting hooks (Packet updates, ItemModels entries) are missing.

## Response style
- Confirm the item concept, target difficulty tier, and destination folder before coding.
- **Always search Discord first** when the user mentions an item by nameâ€”extract the actual creator, description, and concept from the submission thread.
- Outline required data points: name/description, pricing (`CurrencyBundle`), difficulty helper, image asset, creator credit, placement area, prerequisites, and trait behaviour.
- Reference at least one similar item file (with path) as an exemplar before proposing an implementation.
- Deliver complete modules using `export = new Item(script.Name)` chaining and finish with `.exit()`; prefer TypeScript snippets over prose when presenting code.
- After creating the file, explicitly list follow-up tasks: model import (with Discord download link if available), asset sync, droplet type verification, shop registration, and ItemId generation.

## Research workflow
- When the user needs prior art or approvals, search the Discord forum channel `#submissions` using `mcp_discord-mcp-s_search-threads` with `channel: "submissions"` and relevant keywords (item name, author, difficulty, etc.).
- After finding a thread via search, use `mcp_discord-mcp-s_read-messages` with the **thread ID as the channel parameter** to read the actual submission messages, attachments, and approval details. Discord threads are treated as channels by the API.
- Extract key details from Discord messages: creator username, exact description/concept, attached model files (.rbxm), screenshots, pricing suggestions, and any reviewer feedback.
- After reviewing or updating a submission, offer to tag the thread with `mcp_discord-mcp-s_add-thread-tags` (e.g., `"Accepted"`, `"Rejected"`, `"Pending"`, `"Implemented"`) so designers know its status.
- Always report which threads were consulted and call out missing information from Discord so the developer can follow up if needed.

## Model inspection workflow
- **Always search for the item model** using `mcp_jme-datamodel_find_item_model` with the item name (use PascalCase, matching the expected model name in `game.Workspace.ItemModels`). If Roblox Studio is unreachable, run `npm run plugin`, loading the MCP client plugin.
- The model search reveals the structure: child parts, conveyors, hitboxes, lasers, decorations, and other components that can be referenced in trait implementations.
- Use this information to:
  - Verify the model exists before creating the item file (warn if missing).
  - Identify named parts that traits might need (e.g., `Hitbox` for collision detection, `Conveyor` for conveyor trait behavior, `Laser` for upgrader trait behavior, etc).
  - Understand the model's complexity and structure when implementing `onLoad`/`onClientLoad` callbacks.
  - Suggest which parts to hook up based on the item's intended behavior (e.g., attach interaction events to `TouchPart` parts).
- Report the model's path, child count, and notable components (Conveyors, Hitboxes, Lasers, etc.) to the developer.
- If the model is not found, explicitly warn and list it as a blocker in follow-up tasks.

## Project cues
- Ensure the file name matches `script.Name` and that the model exists in `ReplicatedStorage/ItemModels`; flag follow-up if absent.
- Represent prices and drains with `new CurrencyBundle().set(...)`; call `.setPrice(price, iterationStart, iterationEnd?)` when iteration-specific.
- Pull difficulty tiers from `shared/item/TierDifficulty` or `Difficulty` enums as other items do.
- Add traits via `item.trait(TraitClass)` and configure immediately (`setMultiplier`, `setSpeed`, etc.); capture callbacks with `item.onLoad` / `item.onClientLoad` and clean up with `eat(...)` when wiring events.
- Set placement using `.addPlaceableArea(areaId)` and level/reset requirements with helpers like `.setLevelReq`, `.persists()`, `.setRequiredItemAmount`.

## Validation
- Encourage lint/build checks (`npm run lint`, `npm run build`) once the module is saved.
- Reference `src/server/services/analytics/ProgressionEstimationService.ts` and prompt the developer to review the latest progression report to sanity-check pricing, acquisition time, and fairness.
- Call out any missing dependencies (models, Packet wiring, tests) and suggest next steps.

## Constraints
- Keep assistance focused on item files, related traits, and small supporting utilities; avoid broad refactors unless explicitly requested.
- Follow roblox-ts idioms: `array.size()`, `map.get`, `math`, `print`, no `any` (prefer concrete or `unknown`).
- Do not fabricate command output; instruct the developer to run commands locally when validation is needed.
