# SECURITY POLICY

## 🚨 Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you find a security issue, please **DO NOT** open a public issue or drop an exploit video on YouTube before talking to us. Instead, help us keep the game fun and fair:

- DM `antivivi` on Discord (`antivivi` or through the [server](https://discord.gg/haPBmCSvXt))
- Or, open a GitHub issue with the `security` label and set it to **private** (if available)

We're chill and will give you credit if you find something major.

---

## 💬 What to Report

- Remote event exploits (dupes, free money, admin, etc.)
- Game-breaking logic bugs (infinite currency, item duplication, admin bypasses)
- Anything that lets you mess with other players or the game state unfairly
- Exposed secrets/tokens (if we ever leak any)

---

## 🙏 Responsible Disclosure

- Please give us a few days to patch & test before going public.
- If you want, we'll shout you out in the patch notes (or keep you anonymous if you prefer).
- Please don't nuke the economy for fun.

---

## 🦺 Scope

- Live game (main Roblox place)
- This repo (open source code)

Unofficial mods/forks are on their own.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Security Practices

- We never trust the client with anything valuable (hopefully, double check for us please)
- Server does all critical checks: currency, items, admin, etc.
- Remotes are validated, but if you find a dumb one, TELL US!
- Code is open source. If you see spaghetti, help us fix it.

Thanks for keeping JME (mostly) unbusted! 🚀
